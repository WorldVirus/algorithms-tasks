If the problem giving K sorted arrays and asks us to perform a sorted traversal of all the elements of all arrays, we need to think about K-way Merge pattern.

While solving the problems, we are going to use Heap data structure to keep track of all elements in K arrays.

Time Complexity: O(N logK)
Space Complexity: O(K)
